# AI_Minimax_Alphabeta
Implementation of a Minimax and Alphabeta algorithm on a checkers game

Notes:
Checkers board is of size 8x8
Two players, Star and Circle

  Input:
  Player to start the game
  Type of algorithm
  Max depth search
  Initial board state
  Weights of each row with respect to each player (Circle: Bottom to Top & Star: Top to Bottom)

  Output:
   Next move from the first player
   Instant utility of the first player
   Utility of the player at the terminal node of the search tree
   Total number of nodes visited

Final note: This problem was based on a homework from a graduate AI class at USC.
